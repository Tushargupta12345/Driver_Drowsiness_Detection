# Driver Drowsiness Detection

**Driver Drowsiness Detection** is a real-time system designed to detect signs of driver fatigue using computer vision techniques. It tracks facial landmarks, particularly focusing on the eye aspect ratio (EAR), to monitor the driver's drowsiness level. When prolonged eye closure or yawning is detected, the system triggers an alert to ensure driver safety.

### Features:

- Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV and Dlib.
- Detection of drowsiness based on eye aspect ratio (EAR) and yawning frequency.
- Audio/visual alert system to notify the driver.

### Technologies Used:

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **Dlib**
- **Numpy**
